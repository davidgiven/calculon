INTRODUCTION
============

Calculon is a very small but very fast designed to be embedded into other
programs. It uses LLVM to generate high-quality machine code and is ideal for
shaders, user-supplied mathematical formulae, etc.

The Calculon language itself is a pure functional language with support for
upvalues, tail recursion, and bindings to the standard maths library. It
supports arbitrary sized n-vectors, reals and booleans as first-class values.
SIMD instructions are used whereever possible to make vector operations fast.



SETUP
=====

Calculon is shipped as a set of headers, and doesn't need building itself.
To use, all you need to do is to copy the contents of the include directory
somewhere where your program can see it and include 'calculon.h' (plus, of
course, you have to link against LLVM).

If you're not using C++, you're probably out of luck. Get in touch if you
need to use it from another language; a set of C shims is probably fairly
easy.

Some sample programs and a Makefile which builds them are supplied:

fractal
  Generates an image by running the fractal.cal script for each pixel and
  plotting the result as intensity; the supplied fractal.cal draws a
  Mandelbrot.
  
noise
  Illustrates calling out to external functions from with a Calculon script.
  Uses libnoise to generate an image full of Perlin noise.
  
filter
  Provides a very easy way to run Calculon scripts on data: filters numbers
  from stdin to stdout, processing each one with a supplied script.

Assuming the makefile works for you, which it should if you're on OSX or a
reasonable Unixoid, just doing 'make' should build these (they're in the demo
directory).



MORE INFORMATION
================

Calculon's home is at http://cowlark.com/calculon.

Alternatively, you will find a copy of the website (in easier-to-read more-or-
less plain text format) in the doc directory.

Calculon comes with a test suite. To run this, do:

  make test
  
It uses the filter command from the demo directory to actually run the tests
(and will build it automatically). If you make any changes, please run this.
If you find a bug, please write a test that demonstrates it; it will make my
life much easier.
